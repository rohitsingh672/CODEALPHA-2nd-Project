# CODEALPHA-2nd-Project
ðŸ“Š Glad to share my second project as a Data Science Intern at Code Alpha!
In this project, I worked on Unemployment Analysis using Python, where I analyzed unemployment trends across different regions and time periods. This project helped me improve my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and analysis using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Thankful to Code Alpha for providing this great opportunity to enhance my practical data science knowledge! ðŸŒŸ
